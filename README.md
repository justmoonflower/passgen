Interactive Password Generator

For the module three challenge, we were asked to create a password generator for employers to use. The password generator must include prompts asking the user what they would like/not like to include in their password. It also had a set specific amount of characters the user has to choose from. Using JavaScript I incorporated event listeners, variables, strings, and other elements to make the web application interactive.
